_A rare website appears_

#### Why?
Late 2018, I had two simple goals:

* create a simple (static) website
	* ...that can eventually be home to a articles and projects
	* ...relatively low maintenance
* create a decentralised (mobile) operating system
	* DAT, IPFS, Ethereum, etc, etc
	* A personal project to keep me interest for the next few <strike>months</strike> years

...the latter's going to take a while, so: 1 of 2.

#### Okay...

I''m slowly, but surely accepting GitHub over GitLab and BitBucket.
